\section{Operational Transformation}

\subsection{Introduction} 
Consistency maintenance is significant challenge in any collaborative ediotor.
Most innovative technique for maintaing it is Operational Transformation.
We concentarte on integrative review of all OPT techniques and 
their issues,algorithms and achievements

\subsection{Preliminaries}
In this section some basic concepts,definitions and terminologies are introduced.
Operational transformation technique allows two type of operations called local operations and remote opeartions.
Local operations are nothing but operations that are genearted by local site.
Where as remote opeartions are those operations taht are generated at some other site other than local site.
Local opeartions are executed immediately with out any changes but remote opeartions have to be transformed against existing operations before execution.  
\\Now we introduce some defintions.

Definition 1:causal ordering relation '->'
\\Given two operations Oa and Ob,generated at sites i and j,then Oa->Ob,iff (1)i=j and generationd of Oa happened before
the generation of Ob or (2)i \ne j and execution of  Oa at site j happened before the generation of Ob or (3)there exists an
opeartion Ox,such that Oa->Ox and Ox->Ob.

Definition 2:dependent and Independent operations
\\Given two operations Oa and Ob,(1)Ob is dependent on Oa iff Oa->Ob.(2)Oa and Ob are independent(or concurrent),
expressed as Oa || Ob,iff neither Oa->Ob nor Ob->Oa








%The report is organized as follows: Section 1 provides the background knowledge and the need for a continuous authentication model for smart phones.
%Section 2 discusses about general experiment setup.
%Section 3 discusses about the various approaches and their performance in authentication. Future scope is discussed in section 5. 
%Section 6 draws the conclusions for the work done.
